# Machine Learning Competitions

This repository contains my solutions and experiments for various machine learning competitions, primarily from Kaggle.

## Competitions

Here are the competitions currently in this repository:

### Data

The datasets for these competitions are not included in this repository as per the competition rules. You will need to download them from the respective Kaggle competition pages and place them in the `dataset` directory within each competition's folder.
